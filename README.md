<p><b>CLI List is a commandline program written in C++ for tracking a list tied to a user that will be created. Functionality is minimal, 
but writting the code was fun!!!!</b><b> A user is created when a new username is typed in that does not exsist in the list.txt file that is created when 
running the program. This file stores all of the users and lists belonging to them.</b></p>

<p><b>Keep in mind, this is a fun beginner friendly project... No authentication or security is implimented to keep data stored safely in list.txt.</b></p>
